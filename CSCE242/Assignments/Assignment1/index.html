        <h1>How well did the United states perform in the 2024 Olympics </h1>
        <h2><em>BY: Josh Natkin</em></h2>
        <p>Many expected the United States to come into the 2024 Olympics as the heavy favorites to leave with the most trophies. While they accomplished that goal, many U.S.A citizens found our results dissapointing. While we seemed to easily roll win the most medals overall, we couldn't grab first place for gold medals. We ended up tying China for the most gold medals in the games.
             </p>
        <p>
            How have we been able to dominate the gold for so long and suddenly have China surpass for more gold medals in the last two olympics? One reason would be that American led sports have grown tremendously over seas, take track and field for example. America also has a sports culture dominated by leagues like the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. China on the other hand, has focesed on much smaller sports, however all those medals add up tremendously.
